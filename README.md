Online Associative Experimental Design (OAED)
The OAED software is a new tool that can be used to design experiments for protein crystallization by extracting the major parameters that are most likely to yield crystals from the results of previously conducted experiments. The OAED has several advantages over the offline AED version. First, it is more accessible, as it can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. Second, it is more up-to-date, as the computation is constantly being updated based on experimental data. Third, it is more efficient, as it can generate a list of experiments in a short amount of time, which does not depend on the userâ€™s computer performance.
